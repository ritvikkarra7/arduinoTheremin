# arduinoTheremin

A theremin is a musical instrument that you play without touching. It has two sensors, both of which track how far an object (typically a human hand) is from the sensor. One sensor controls the pitch of the output signal, and the other controls its volume. 

My build uses 2 HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors as the inputs and 1 piezoelectric buzzer to produce the output signal.
